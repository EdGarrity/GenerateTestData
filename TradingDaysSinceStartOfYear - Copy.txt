def add_temporal_data(stock_data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Adds temporal data to the input DataFrame.

    The input stock_data DataFrame consists of stock information for several stocks from the first trading day of 1947 to the last trading day of 2022.  The DataFrame comtains many columns.  The name of the stock is in the 'Stock' column of the DataFrame.  The date is the row.name of the DataFrame

    For each record in the DataFrame, this function will add the following fields:

    TradingDaysInYear
        Calculate TradingDaysInYear by counting how many days the DataFrame has information for that stock in the given year from the first record to the last record for this stock for the year.

    TradingDaysSinceStartOfYear
        Where TradingDaysSinceStartOfYear is calculated by counting how many days the DataFrame has information for that stock in the given year, not how many calendar days are in the year. (1 = First trading day of the year, 2 = second trading day of the year, ...)

    Parameters:
        stock_data (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame containing stock market or financial data. The structure of the DataFrame is as follows:
        'Stock': A string that represents the stock trading symbol
        'Date': Column representing dates in a valid date format, compatible with the 'pd.to_datetime()' function

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with the updated 'stock_data' including the added temporal-related information.

    Example:

        Suppose we have a DataFrame 'stock_data' with columns 'Stock' and 'Date', and we want to add temporal data to it. We can use the function as follows:

        >>> updated_data = add_temporal_data(stock_data)
        >>> print(updated_data)

    Note:
        - The 'Date' column in the 'stock_data' DataFrame should be in a valid date format, compatible with the 'pd.to_datetime()' function used in this function.
        - The 'stock_data' DataFrame will be modified in place to include the additional temporal data.

This program downloads stock data and adds the `TradingDaysInYear` field

For each record in the downloaded stock data, add the following field:

TradingDaysInYear
    Calculate TradingDaysInYear by counting how many days the DataFrame has information for that stock in the given year from the first record to the last record for this stock for the year.

Parameters:
    None
    
Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with the stock data including the added temporal-related information.

    Calculate the number of trading days in each year for each stock in the DataFrame.

    This function calculates the number of trading days in each year for each stock
    in the provided DataFrame based on the non-null values in the 'Adj Close' column.

    Parameters:
        stock_data (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing stock data with the following columns:
            - 'Symbol': The stock symbol or identifier for each data record.
            - 'Date': The date for each data record. Should be set as the DataFrame index.
            - 'Adj Close': The adjusted closing price of the stock for each data record.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A new DataFrame with the 'TradingDaysInYear' field added.
            The returned DataFrame will be the same as the input 'stock_data'

            The 'TradingDaysInYear' column will contain the number of trading days in each year

            the 'TradingDaysInYear' value will be 0.

    Note:
        The 'Date' column should be set as the DataFrame index, and the data should be sorted in
        chronological order based on the date for correct results.

    Example:
